Given the mineralogy and element partitioning for each mineral, and temperature
(pressure) and oxygen fugacity, one can calculate electrical conductivity of each mineral,
and then using a model for a conductivity of an aggregate, one can calculate the
aggregate conductivity. Several models have been proposed to calculate the aggregate
conductivity (McLachlan et al., 1990), but here I use the Hashin-Shtrikman average. The
upper bound by this method is given by
